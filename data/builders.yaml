  bio: "Don't let him catch you sitting down drinking a VB when there is work to be done. Or even worse, don't let it slip that you don't know what you are talking about in his presence. Once just a simple spade boy commented that Portland Cement is from Portland. The Fearless leader turned his back on the poor boy and that boy never saw him front on again."
- name: "Form Master"
  img: "/img/form.png"
  bio: "The Form Master is incharge of designing and cutting all forms to maths. He seems pretty good at this but no one is really that sure as no one else knows math. Then again, does anyone? What's the zero all about? Could I have zero bags of concrete please? I heard it's all made up"
- name: "Vice Foreman"

- name: "The Free Mason"
  img: "/img/the_mason.png"
  bio: "He comes from a long line of Free Masons. Though unfortunately for us he was not so politely asked to leave when suggesting the Masons should allow females to join. Fortunately for us he stole the Masons book of sacrifices and can be found performing sacrificial rituals most fridays to appease the concrete gods and Wellington City Council  "
