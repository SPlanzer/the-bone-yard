This skate park strongly adheres to the pre-modern philosophy of mid-century brutalism. The features are packed in like a concofiny of starved zoo animals that are looking for their first opportunity to escape and take revenge. 

One can tell from a glance this skate park was never meant to be ridden. This is event by ill proportions that seem to be a fuck you to the natural world and coping so rough the sovirts T-34 tank would not manage the ground.

The only conclusion that can be drawn from this installation is that it is a work of a lone lunatic with little knowledge of skate park design or more likely it is part of some sick individual's perverse idea of a joke.
