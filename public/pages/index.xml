      <description>The Bone Yard is a gentrification, reinvigoration, beautification, regeneration, skin care, nature conservation project and bottle recycling drop off depot.
This now beautiful spot once lay in waste. However in 1935 during the Great Depression, the government sent a team of relief workers to start work on the Bone Yard. At first a team of just five men worked with pickaxes to carve away at the rock. Over the years the numbers grew, with the workers living in a large camp nearby.</description>
