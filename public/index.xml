      <description>The Bone Yard is a gentrification, reinvigoration, beautification, regeneration, skin care, nature conservation project and bottle recycling drop off depot.
This now beautiful spot once lay in waste. However in 1935 during the Great Depression, the government sent a team of relief workers to start work on the Bone Yard. At first a team of just five men worked with pickaxes to carve away at the rock. Over the years the numbers grew, with the workers living in a large camp nearby.</description>

      <description>The Bone Yard would not be possible without the hard yakka of the men that show up from time to time and put in the hard yards.
Undertaking such a modern feat of engineering is no easy task but the lifestyle these builders live is even harder. None have a fixed abode and chose to follow the dusty road town to town looking for the next abandoned unused lot to build the next quarter pipe.</description>

      <description>This skate park strongly adheres to the pre-modern philosophy of mid-century brutalism. The features are packed in like a concofiny of starved zoo animals that are looking for their first opportunity to escape and take revenge.
One can tell from a glance this skate park was never meant to be ridden. This is evident by ill proportions that seem to be a fuck you to the natural world and coping so rough the soviets T-34 tank would not manage the ground.</description>
