      <description>This skate park strongly adheres to the pre-modern philosophy of mid-century brutalism. The features are packed in like a concofiny of starved zoo animals that are looking for their first opportunity to escape and take revenge.
One can tell from a glance this skate park was never meant to be ridden. This is evident by ill proportions that seem to be a fuck you to the natural world and coping so rough the soviets T-34 tank would not manage the ground.</description>
