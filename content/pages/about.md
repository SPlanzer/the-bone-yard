The Bone Yard is a gentrification, reinvigoration, beautification, regeneration, skin care, nature conservation project and bottle recycling drop off depot.

This now beautiful spot once lay in waste. However in 1935 during the Great Depression, the government sent a team of relief workers to start work on the Bone Yard. At first a team of just five men worked with pickaxes to carve away at the rock. Over the years the numbers grew, with the workers living in a large camp nearby. The project was delayed by World War II, and then again in 1945 by a large avalanche. The men worked in very tough conditions and died in their hundreds by landslide and rockblast.

No longer does Newtown ring out with their songs nor their fights but they have left behind this land mark that people travel this here globe to pay visit.
