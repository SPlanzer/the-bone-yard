The Bone Yard would not be possible without the hard yakka of the men that show up from time to time and put in the hard yards.

Undertaking such a modern feat of engineering is no easy task but the lifestyle these builders live is even harder. None have a fixed abode and chose to follow the dusty road town to town looking for the next abandoned unused lot to build the next quarter pipe. Once a lot is found it is cold nights in the makeshift shanty town. A town of no laws where men are stabbed just for mentioning the possibilities of a nice, crisp, buttery ledge.
