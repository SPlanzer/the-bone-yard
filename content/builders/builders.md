The Bone Yard would not be possible without the hard yakka of the men that show up time to time and put in the hard yards. 

Undertaking such a modern feat of engineering is non easy task but the lifestyle these builders live is even harder. Non have afixed abode and chose to follow the dusty road town to town looking for the next abandooed unused lot to build the next quarter pipe. Once a lot is found it is cold nights in the make shift shanty town. A town of no laws where a men are stabbed just for mentioning the possibilities of a nice ledge for some city folk fangdangled street grind.
